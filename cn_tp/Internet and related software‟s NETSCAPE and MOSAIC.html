             AOL renamed the Netscape Communications Corporation to New Aurora Corporation,and transferred the Netscape brand to themselves. AOL sold the former Netscape company to Microsoft, who in turn sold them to Facebook.The former Netscape company is currently a non-operating subsidiary of Facebook, still known as New Aurora Corporation. Today, Netscape is a brand name owned by Verizon Media, a subsidiary of Verizon Communications.

             <h2>Mosaic</h2>
             National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) Mosaic, or simply Mosaic, is the web browser that popularized the World Wide Web and the Internet. It was also a client for earlier internet protocols such as File Transfer Protocol, Network News Transfer Protocol, and Gopher. The browser was named for its support of multiple internet protocols. Its intuitive interface, reliability, Microsoft Windows port, and simple installation all contributed to its popularity within the web, as well as on Microsoft operating systems.Mosaic was also the first browser to display images inline with text instead of displaying them in a separate window. It is often described as the first graphical web browser, though it was preceded by WorldWideWeb, the lesser-known Erwise, and ViolaWWW.

Mosaic was developed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign beginning in late 1992. NCSA released it in 1993, and officially discontinued development and support on January 7, 1997.

Starting in 1995, Mosaic lost market share to Netscape Navigator and only had a tiny fraction of users left by 1997, when the project was discontinued. Microsoft licensed Mosaic to create Internet Explorer in 1995.

    <h3>Mosaic vs. Netscape</h3>
    <p><h3></h3>

        When Mosaic was introduced to the Internet community, it revolutionized net surfing.  It's 
graphical hypertext interface allowed users to seamlessly navigate from location to location on the 
net, mixing text, graphics, and sound in documents along the way.  Mosaic was originally 
developed by the University of Illinois-Urbana and the National Center for Supercomputer 
Applications (NCSA), makers of the popular NCSA Telnet for IBM and Macintosh computers.  
However, Mosaic was only a temporary project.  The goal was to develop a complete WWW 
browser and then allow development to be continued independently.  That transition has just 
occurred.  Many of the original programmers who wrote Mosaic now work for Netscape 
Communications Corporation, and have been developing a similar program called Netscape 
Navigator.  They recently released version 1.0 (after several earlier releases) for free to academic 
institutions and non-profit users.  The replacement of Mosaic by Netscape is inevitable because 
development of Mosaic has ceased.  Netscape also promises to be a superior browser in many 
ways, primarily in terms of speed.  However, these promises should not be accepted blindly.  I 
will compare the features and performance of Mosaic version 2.0 alpha 7 and Netscape Navigator 
version 1.0 for Windows running under Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 and Microsoft 
TCP/IP-32.  Both of these programs are available for most major graphical environments 
(Windows, Macintosh, X-Windows) and can be found on The Moment WWW page.</p>

<p><h2></h2>
        The main advantage Netscape claims over Mosaic is speed.  It is true that Netscape includes 
many features that can reduce transfer times drastically under certain circumstances.  Most of the 
improvements deal with image transfers.  For example, if a document has multiple images in it, 
Netscape can download them simultaneously, whereas Mosaic must download them sequentially.  
In everyday use, this does often speed things up.  Netscape also supports both JPEG and GIF 
image formats, Mosaic only supports GIFs.  JPEG files are generally much smaller than GIF files 
because of a more sophisticated compression algorithm that they use, and should thus transfer 
faster than comparable GIF files.  In practice, this does not always improve transfer rates.  This is 
because the JPEG files, although smaller, require much more computation to decompress them.  
On a 486DX2-66, a moderately powerful IBM clone, GIFs and JPEGs tend to transfer at roughly 
similar speeds.  Presumably as processors become more powerful, the smaller JPEG file size will 
become more advantageous.  Another important feature of Netscape is the ability to take action 
before a transfer is complete.  For example, if a web page is loading and you see a link you want to 
follow, or decide you want to turn around and back up, you do not have to wait for the whole page 
to be sent.  This can be a major time saver.</p>

<p><h2></h2>
        Netscape also has a slew of tricks to speed up transfers of hypertext documents designed 
specifically for Netscape Navigator 1.0 or later.  One clever trick is multiple resolution graphic 
images.  It is possible to create a hypertext document that will transfer small low resolution images 
at first, and then after all other text and graphic transfers are completed, go back and replace them 
with larger high resolution images.</p>

<p>
    <h2></h2>    However, for straight data transfers, Mosaic still crushes Netscape on my machine.  For 
example, transferring a 1.7 megabyte sound file from my home page on the CUNIX cluster 
typically takes 25-35 seconds.  Transferring the same file using Netscape 1.0 takes 80-100 
seconds.  I have been monitoring this particular transfer for several days and at different times of 
the day, each time doing one Mosaic and one Netscape transfer.  This difference can only be due to 
overhead in the Netscape program itself.  Again, this difference should diminish with increasing 
computational power, but for the time being Mosaic is the clear winner (for the Windows platform 
at least).</p>

<p>
   <h2></h2>     Mosaic and Netscape also require a few important support programs.  If you are using 
Mosaic, and want to be able to view JPEG files externally, a program called LView is included.  
Although Mosaic can't display JPEG images within hypertext documents, you can configure it to 
automatically view JPEG files using LView.  Netscape does not require this.  Most sound clips on 
the web are available in the AU format.  This is supported by Mosaic, but for Netscape an external 
player is required.  For other digitized sound formats, such as WAV, VOC and SND, an external 
player is required for either program. Although no animation formats are supported by either 
browser, multimedia files are becoming popular on the net and you may want to get players for 
them as well.  Shareware players for FLI/FLC, AVI, and MPEG animation formats as well as 
MOV Quicktime movies are widely available.</p>

<p>
      <h2></h2>  Netscape has already just about taken over the market for WWW browsers from Mosaic, 
and completion of this process is guaranteed.  However, Mosaic still has a raw speed advantage 
under certain circumstances, and should not be abandoned yet.  I still recommend trying out both 
programs to see which one suits your browsing needs best.  For some, like myself, it may be 
necessary to keep both programs installed for a while for different purposes.
