             <h3>Services provided by the Physical layer:</h3>
             <ul class="points">
<li><strong>Line Configuration:</strong> It defines the way how two or more devices can be connected physically.</li>
<li><strong>Data Transmission:</strong> It defines the transmission mode whether it is simplex, half-duplex or full-duplex mode between the two devices on the network. </li>
<li><strong>Topology:</strong> It defines the way how network devices are arranged.</li>
<li><strong>Signals:</strong> It determines the type of the signal used for transmitting the information.</li>
</ul>



            <h3>Services provided by the Data Link Layer:</h3>
            <p align="center"><img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/computer-network/images/data-link-layer.png" alt="Data Link Layer"></p>
            <ul class="points">
<li><strong>Framing &amp; Link access:</strong> Data Link Layer protocols encapsulate each network frame within a Link layer frame before the transmission across the link. A frame consists of a data field in which network layer datagram is inserted and a number of data fields. It specifies the structure of the frame as well as a channel access protocol by which frame is to be transmitted over the link.</li>
<li><strong>Reliable delivery:</strong> Data Link Layer provides a reliable delivery service, i.e., transmits the network layer datagram without any error. A reliable delivery service is accomplished with transmissions and acknowledgements.  A data link layer mainly provides the reliable delivery service over the links as they have higher error rates and they can be corrected locally, link at which an error occurs rather than forcing to retransmit the data.</li>
<li><strong>Flow control:</strong> A receiving node can receive the frames at a faster rate than it can process the frame.  Without flow control, the receiver's buffer can overflow, and frames can get lost. To overcome this problem, the data link layer uses the flow control to prevent the sending node on one side of the link from overwhelming the receiving node on another side of the link.</li>
<li><strong>Error detection:</strong> Errors can be introduced by signal attenuation and noise. Data Link Layer protocol provides a mechanism to detect one or more errors. This is achieved by adding error detection bits in the frame and then receiving node can perform an error check. </li>
<li><strong>Error correction:</strong> Error correction is similar to the Error detection, except that receiving node not only detect the errors but also determine where the errors have occurred in the frame.</li>
<li><strong>Half-Duplex &amp; Full-Duplex:</strong> In a Full-Duplex mode, both the nodes can transmit the data at the same time. In a Half-Duplex mode, only one node can transmit the data at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Services Provided by the Network Layer</h3>
<br>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Guaranteed delivery:</strong> This layer provides the service which guarantees that the packet will arrive at its destination.</li>
<li><strong>Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay:</strong> This service guarantees that the packet will be delivered within a specified host-to-host delay bound.</li>
<li><strong>In-Order packets:</strong> This service ensures that the packet arrives at the destination in the order in which they are sent.</li>
<li><strong>Guaranteed max jitter:</strong> This service ensures that the amount of time taken between two successive transmissions at the sender is equal to the time between their receipt at the destination.</li>
<li><strong>Security services:</strong> The network layer provides security by using a session key between the source and destination host. The network layer in the source host encrypts the payloads of datagrams being sent to the destination host. The network layer in the destination host would then decrypt the payload. In such a way, the network layer maintains the data integrity and source authentication services.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Services provided by the Transport Layer</h3>
<br>The services provided by the transport layer are similar to those of the data link layer. The data link layer provides the services within a single network while the transport layer provides the services across an internetwork made up of many networks. The data link layer controls the physical layer while the transport layer controls all the lower layers.
<br>
<strong>The services provided by the transport layer protocols can be divided into five categories:</strong><br>

<ul class="points">
<li>End-to-end delivery</li>
<li>Addressing</li>
<li>Reliable delivery</li>
<li>Flow control</li>
<li>Multiplexing</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Services of session Layers</h3>
The session layer (layer 5) is responsible for establishing, managing, synchronizing and terminating sessions between end-user application processes.
<br><ul class="points"><li>It works as a dialog controller. It allows the systems to communicate in either half-duplex or full-duplex mode of communication.</li><li>It is responsible for token management. Through this, it prevents the two users to simultaneously attempt the same critical operation.</li><li>It synchronizes communication. It adds synchronization points or checkpoints in data streams for long communications. This ensures that data streams up to the checkpoints are successfully received and acknowledged. In case of any failures, only the streams after the checkpoints have to be re-transmitted.</li></ul>

<h3>Services of Presentation Layers</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li><b>Translation:</b> Before being transmitted, information in the form of characters and numbers should be changed to bit streams. The presentation layer is responsible for interoperability between encoding methods as different computers use different encoding methods. It translates data between the formats the network requires and the format the computer.</li>
<li><b>Encryption:</b> It carries out encryption at the transmitter and decryption at the receiver.</li>
<li><b>Compression:</b> It carries out data compression to reduce the bandwidth of the data to be transmitted. The primary role of Data compression is to reduce the number of bits to be 0transmitted. It is important in transmitting multimedia such as audio, video, text etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Services of Application Layers</h3>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Network Virtual terminal:</strong> An application layer allows a user to log on to a remote host. To do so, the application creates a software emulation of a terminal at the remote host. The user's computer talks to the software terminal, which in turn, talks to the host. The remote host thinks that it is communicating with one of its own terminals, so it allows the user to log on.</li>
<li><strong>File Transfer, Access, and Management (FTAM):</strong> An application allows a user to access files in a remote computer, to retrieve files from a computer and to manage files in a remote computer. FTAM defines a hierarchical virtual file in terms of file structure, file attributes and the kind of operations performed on the files and their attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Addressing:</strong> To obtain communication between client and server, there is a need for addressing.  When a client made a request to the server, the request contains the server address and its own address. The server response to the client request, the request contains the destination address, i.e., client address. To achieve this kind of addressing, DNS is used.</li>
<li><strong>Mail Services:</strong> An application layer provides Email forwarding and storage.</li>
<li><strong>Directory Services:</strong> An application contains a distributed database that provides access for  global information about various objects and services.</li>
Authentication: It authenticates the sender or receiver's message or both.
